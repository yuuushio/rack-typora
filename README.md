# Rack

A refined Typora theme tailored for creating polished, professional documents. Inspired by Refine, this theme is designed and optimized for PDF output and printing, ensuring balanced margins and an elegant layout. Ideal for generating documents with a focus on presentation and readability, beyond the standard Typora note-taking or on-screen viewing.

## Usage

### Linux

Both `rack.css` and `rack/` directory go inside `~/.config/Typora/themes/`, and it should work as is.

## Showcase

Please take a look at `markdown-syntax.pdf` to see what the css renders as when exported.

## TODO
- Different H1 font;
- Few improvements on hr, blockquotes; but works well for now.
