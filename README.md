# Rack

A Typora theme for elegant report documents, based on Refine. Designed and optimized for pdf output/printing, rather than just viewing/note-taking.

## Usage

### Linux

Both `rack.css` and `rack/` directory go inside `~/.config/Typora/themes/`, and it should work as is.

## Images

Coming soon...

## TODO
- Style blockquotes
- Different H1 font
- Style table (separate th from tr)
